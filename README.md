# Hong-Kong-Stargazing-Prediction-Website-Project

My dream is to see the Milky Way in naked eyes, or to capture it after long exposure and stack using a camera. Hong Kong is a severely light polluted city, but minor chances of oberserving a shinning sky still exist in the middle of nowhere. World Light Pollution Map is too vast for Hong Kong. Too make it more precise, utilizing the data provided by the Hong Kong Observatory may be helpful in predicting a "Stargazing Level" of Hong Kong.

Project Direction:

1. Project a map of Hong Kong (Tools: **Leaflet**, **Mapbox**)
2. Show signs of major places, can take reference from HKO
3. Stargazing levels of major places shown on map, can be icons, markers or radar graph (colour gradient).
4. Stargazing level is determined by following factors, they are
   1. Light Pollution Level
      1. Sky Brigtness Level
      2. City Brigtness Level
   2. Cloud Density
   3. Period of moon, e.g. Hard to oberserve stars not during new moon
5. Applly location filters based on, e.g. low light pollution, clear sky, etc.
